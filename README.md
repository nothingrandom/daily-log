# Daily Log

This project is a simple way to keep track of daily activities across different projects and scopes of work.

## Usage

To create a new daily log, run the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
./new_log.sh
```

This will create a new Markdown file in the `logs` directory. After the file is created, you will be prompted to select an editor (vscode, nano, or vim) to open the file.

### Tags

The following tags are used to categorize tasks:

- `@triage`: For bug fixing and issue investigation.
- `@support`: For helping other developers or teams.
- `@feature`: For new feature development.
